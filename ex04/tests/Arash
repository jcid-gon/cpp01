O, sacred lord.
O, radiant lord, who grants wisdom, majesty and strength.
My hearth, 
My thoughts,
And all that I can see;
Come!
Servants of the moon and the stars!
My actions,
My last moments,
My sacred devoition;
Witness it all!
With all my might
I shall release this one arrow
And let my body be crushed upon this place!
STELLA!
