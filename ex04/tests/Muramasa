Let go of excess, 
let go of weight,
let go of spped,
to understand myself.
It sure took a long time.
Trace, on.
Esence, unravel.
Perfected ideals, converge.
Forging techniques, reaching critical.
Upon one's arrival,
the use of years of devoted studies.
Upon one's arrival,
the result of countless training...
Forging endlessly to create tombs of swords.
Cutting through bonds, though destiny, through fate...
This is my unparalleled Tsumukari Muramasa.
Severing karma by one's origin.
This is the yaegaki made by sword of Senji.
In short...
Your karma is exonerated!
Take this as your wift to hell!
I'll finish the job with this one swing!
Take a good look at this!
The pulse of my sword, is right here!
Time to set your spirit free!
For this is my Tsumukari Muramasa!
